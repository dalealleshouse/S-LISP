# SLISP
A LISP dialect dedicated to simplicity.

For those of you who know what the "S" stands for, good for you! You  are privy to joke. To all others, it stands for Simple.

Writing a LISP interpreter is a right of passage for those dedicated to the art of computer programming. This is my right of passage and labor of love.
